Wishes to realization
1) Application - Spring Boot
2) Data access layer. As a storage - any DBMS (for example, h2, mysql, postgresql, etc.) or text files. For access use jdbc/jooq/hibernate/java.io.* (in case of storing in text files)
3) Web forms using any template engine, like thymeleaf
4) Spring MVC controllers with necessary rests must be implemented to pass data to the web form from the backend
Examples of configuration and structure:

Preferred implementation order:
1) Data layer (storage)
2) Services and rests
3) Web-interface. Has the lowest priority, i.e. the main task is to implement REST controllers, which implement all the functions of the application.
4) Tasks of higher complexity
